# Jadel Tech RD Web Revenue Readiness - 2026-08-30

## Decision

Jadel Tech RD can present Nexus AI Automation v0.3.0 as a governed service engine for public commercial offerings, but the public website must not expose admin APIs, secrets, direct worker controls, payment automation, marketplace actions, social publishing, contract acceptance, or financial execution.

## Implemented public surfaces

- Homepage: `https://jadeltechrd.com/`
- Services catalog: `https://jadeltechrd.com/#servicios`
- Pricing: `https://jadeltechrd.com/#precios`
- PayPal payment section: `https://jadeltechrd.com/#pagos`
- Privacy policy: `https://jadeltechrd.com/?view=privacy`
- Terms of service: `https://jadeltechrd.com/?view=terms`
- Data deletion instructions: `https://jadeltechrd.com/?view=data-deletion`

## Nexus service mapping

- AI automation and agentic architecture

- AI governance and production readiness

## Payment control

PayPal receiving account authorized by owner: `darklife_jadel@hotmail.com`.

Current implementation opens PayPal and instructs customers to confirm scope first. This avoids an unsafe custom checkout and avoids pretending a verified hosted PayPal link exists.

Recommended next payment upgrade:

1. Create an official PayPal Payment Link, Button, or PayPal.Me URL inside PayPal.
2. Test a low-value transaction.
3. Replace the generic PayPal link in `index.html` and `app.js` with the verified URL.
4. Keep payment confirmation and delivery scope human-reviewed.

## External evidence used

- GitHub Pages custom domains require repository Pages configuration plus DNS records for the apex domain and optional `www`; DNS propagation can take up to 24 hours.

- PayPal.Me lets customers send money through a PayPal.Me link without sharing email, but the handle must be created and verified by the account owner. Source: https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/paypalme-frequently-asked-questions-help432

## Open production gate

`jadeltechrd.com` DNS was not externally verified as healthy during this change. Do not mark the site as fully production-ready until:

- `jadeltechrd.com` resolves to GitHub Pages records or an approved CDN/proxy.
- `www.jadeltechrd.com` is configured or intentionally omitted.
- GitHub Pages serves the site over HTTPS.
- PayPal link is official and verified.
- Any Nexus admin endpoint remains private behind authentication and network controls.
