# Jadel Tech RD Web Revenue Readiness - 2026-08-30

## Decision

Jadel Tech RD can present Nexus AI Automation v0.3.0 as a governed service engine for public commercial offerings, but the public website must not expose admin APIs, secrets, direct worker controls, payment automation, marketplace actions, social publishing, contract acceptance, or financial execution.

## Implemented public surfaces

- Homepage: `https://jadeltechrd.com/`
- Services catalog: `https://jadeltechrd.com/#servicios`
- Pricing: `https://jadeltechrd.com/#precios`
- PayPal payment section: `https://jadeltechrd.com/#pagos`
- Privacy policy: `https://jadeltechrd.com/?view=privacy`
- Terms of service: `https://jadeltechrd.com/?view=terms`
- Data deletion instructions: `https://jadeltechrd.com/?view=data-deletion`

## Nexus service mapping

- AI automation and agentic architecture
- Support and ticketing agents
- Sales and lead intelligence
- Social trend intelligence
- CineForge video pipeline
- Meta/Facebook app integration and review readiness
- Dashboards and decision intelligence
- Revenue opportunity intelligence
- Quant research and trading risk systems
- AI governance and production readiness
- Multi-agent orchestration

## Payment control

PayPal receiving account authorized by owner: `darklife_jadel@hotmail.com`.

Current implementation uses owner-provided PayPal Payment Links for supported services and keeps scope confirmation available before payment. This avoids an unsafe custom checkout while moving supported services to PayPal-hosted checkout.

## 2026-08-31 Nexus automation update

The public site now exposes the full launch service catalog requested by the owner and connects the configurator to a Nexus-style request flow:

- Service selection builds a scoped commercial brief.
- The payment request CTA remains disabled until at least one service is selected.
- The generated request uses PayPal as the authorized payment method. When exactly one supported service is selected, the CTA opens the official PayPal Payment Link for that service.
- `nexus_ai_automation_v0.3.0` is represented as the operating protocol for intake, evidence, reconciliation and supervised activation.

Local Nexus evidence keeps direct PayPal API execution in `reconciliation_only` mode. Therefore, the website may link to PayPal-hosted checkout pages, but must not create payments, payouts, withdrawals, proposals, contract acceptance, social publishing, trading actions or production agent execution without human approval and a verified backend connector.

Owner-provided PayPal Payment Links verified with HTTP 200 before publication:

- Architecture setup: `https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/8XFP5NDQUN9J2`
- Support setup: `https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/NN639WR9P7LPW`
- Support monthly: `https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/G7EJQLHYUKLG8`
- Meta/Facebook setup: `https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/5EX2AGMB85P62`
- AI Governance setup: `https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/3TQUF8WU2WHR2`

Recommended next payment upgrade:

1. Add official PayPal links for the remaining catalog services.
2. Test a low-value transaction per payment link.
3. Add a backend webhook and immutable payment ledger before automating fulfillment.
4. Keep payment confirmation and delivery scope human-reviewed.

## Open production gate

`jadeltechrd.com` DNS was not externally verified as healthy during this change. Do not mark the site as fully production-ready until:

- `jadeltechrd.com` resolves to GitHub Pages records or an approved CDN/proxy.
- `www.jadeltechrd.com` is configured or intentionally omitted.
- GitHub Pages serves the site over HTTPS.
- PayPal links are official, tested and reconciled.
- Any Nexus admin endpoint remains private behind authentication and network controls.
